        Achilles tendinitis is an overuse injury of the Achilles (uh-KILL-eez)
        tendon, the band of tissue that connects calf muscles at the back of the
        lower leg to your heel bone. Achilles tendinitis most commonly occurs in
        runners who have suddenly increased the intensity or duration of their
        runs. It's also common in middle-aged people who play sports, such as
        tennis or basketball, only on the weekends. Most cases of Achilles
        tendinitis can be treated with relatively simple, at-home care under
        your doctor's supervision. Self-care strategies are usually necessary to
        prevent recurring episodes. More-serious cases of Achilles tendinitis
        can lead to tendon tears (ruptures) that may require surgical repair.

      <span style="font-weight: 500">
        The pain associated with Achilles tendinitis typically begins as a mild
        ache in the back of the leg or above the heel after running or other
        sports activity. Episodes of more-severe pain may occur after prolonged
        running, stair climbing or sprinting. You might also experience
        tenderness or stiffness, especially in the morning, which usually
        improves with mild activity.
